Welcome to Minesweeper !
Minesweeper is a game where mines are hidden in a grid. 
Safe boxes in the grid have numbers telling you how many bombs touch the box. 
You can use the flag function to mark a box without discovering it (such as a bomb for exemple). If you discover a mine you loose the game! 
You win if you have discovered all the safe boxes. 

The three difficulty levels are :
- Beginner (9x9 with 10 mines)
- Intermediate (16x16 with 40 mines) 
- Custom (you choose the size of the grid and the amount of bomb(s))
 
Minesweeper saves your best time in a table score.
You just have to write Make in the linux command to launch the programm.

Once you have launch the programm, you will have to choose your mode by typing a number between 1 and 3.
If you have choosed the number 3 you will have to type the dimension of the grid and the number of mines.

After that, you can choose between discovering a box or flaging it (the flag shows the number 70 instead of F).
In each cases you will continue the game by choosing the line and the column of your next box.
You will do this until you win or loose.
When the game ends, you can play again or quit by typing either Y (for yes) or N (for no).
Note : if you won, you can put you name and mode, we will add it to a table score so that you can know who's the best at minesweeper !
